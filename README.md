# Beat- Detection

This project creates an audio visualizer using cubes. It uses an audio source to collect spectrum data which is then passed to another script that spawns in cubes and scales them accordingly based on the samples[512] they are linked to.

# Key Concepts

Audio Analysis
Visual Feedback 

## Example Usage

When using this codebase locate the scenes w/ genre/artist names

Locate the AudioSource GameObject within the Hierarchy

Whatever MP3 that you choose to import into the project can replace the clip that is within this box.

Click Play to test

## Bugs
Currently there is a bug with how fast the cubes expand and contract causing it to look really jumpy.
